## Introduction

Finally hosting a minimalistic static blog because by the time I got around to adding it
on my website, VueJS had changed much and I should have first upgraded to the versions in
order to move forward. JavaScript frameworks are not for procrastinators like you and me,
I swear.. They seem like they need constant vigilance and updates.
Not saying I don't like how my website had turned out but.. well.. jokes aside, don't be a
procrastinator if you don't want this to happen to you. *sobs in the corner*

*Wiping tears off* Sooooooo... here we are!

Welcome to my new blog which... *drumroll* isn't Wordpress! :D

No kidding Wordpress was the framework that had made blogging so easy that I was able to start
in the first place. But.. I haven't been able to keep up with it. I kinda like Markdown now so
what better than Hugo.

Fun fact: I basically copied and pasted the commands from Hugo Quickstart. So.. the post and
project names are also pretty much the same..
(Yes we're dealing with that level of laziness. I bet not making blog on Vue makes sense now)

Annnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyhooo.. hope I'm able to write some stuff here every now and then.

Stay tuned.
Thanks for reading. :)
